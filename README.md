An amazing design for your website! I know it would go against the flow of the design, but it would probably be best if the color squares had the names of the pagers they were linking to. For Asking Questions, the questions are in the input box while on other pages they are above the input. For Odd Or Even, the return prompt is an array where other pages it is a string. For desktop 1920 by 1080 pixels, the response text is quite small. On Mobile at 425 by 720 pixels, the pages load in zoomed, which usually means that the elements stretch larger than 425 pixels, and is noticable with how the navigation button on the left touches the border while there is padding on the right navigation button. These are all nitpicks though, the website is fully functional and great to look at.
